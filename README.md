I'm Samuela Abigail, an AI & DS graduate! I like collaborating with people and building unique real-time projectsâœ¨, and love coding in my spare timeðŸ˜„. Teaching and learning together with peers is an enriching experience for me, so you'll find me mostly lurking around discussion sections of many developer and coder platforms or just reading blog posts somewhere. Let's connect on LinkedIn to discuss doubts, learn, and grow together!
