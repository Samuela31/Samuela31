I'm Samuela Abigail, an AI & DS graduate! I like collaborating with people and building unique real-time projectsâœ¨, and a coding enthusiast who loves coding in my free timeðŸ˜„. Teaching and learning together with peers is an enriching experience, so you'll find me lurking around discussion sections of many developer and coder platforms or just reading blog posts somewhere. Let's connect on LinkedIn to discuss doubts, learn, and grow together!
